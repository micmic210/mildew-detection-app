# Mildew Detection in Cherry Leaves

## Project Overview

This project aims to solve a critical challenge faced by Farmy & Foods, an agricultural company struggling with powdery mildew detection on cherry leaves. Powdery mildew is a fungal disease that negatively impacts crop yield and quality. The current detection process is manual, requiring approximately 30 minutes per tree, making it inefficient and impractical for large-scale farming.

## Project Objectives

To address this issue, this project leverages Machine Learning (ML) and Computer Vision to develop an AI-powered Mildew Detection Dashboard with the following functionalities:
1. Visual Differentiation:
    - Provide data visualizations to help differentiate healthy vs. mildew-infected leaves.
2. Automated Classification:
    - Build a binary classification model that predicts whether a given leaf image is healthy or infected.
3. Scalability:
	- If successful, this system could be scaled and adapted to detect other plant diseases in the future.

By integrating this ML-powered tool into farm operations, Farmy & Foods can significantly reduce labor costs, improve detection accuracy, and increase crop yield.

## Dataset Content

The dataset contains images of cherry leaves categorized into two classes:
- **Healthy leaves**
- **Leaves with powdery mildew**

The images were captured from Farmy & Foods’ cherry crops and are publicly available on Kaggle.

- **Dataset Source**: [Cherry Leaves Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/codeinstitute/cherry-leaves)
- **Dataset Size**: 4208 images

## Business Requirements

The client has outlined the following business requirements:
1.	Visual Differentiation:
	- Conduct a study to analyze and visually distinguish healthy cherry leaves from those infected with powdery mildew.
2.	Mildew Detection & Prediction:
	- Develop a Machine Learning model that can classify a cherry leaf as healthy or infected, helping predict the presence of powdery mildew in cherry trees.

## Hypotheses and Validation

### Hypotheses
1.	Visual Differences Exist:
    -	Healthy leaves have a uniform texture and consistent color.
	-	Mildew-infected leaves display discoloration, white fungal growth, and surface irregularities.
2.	Machine Learning Can Accurately Detect Mildew:
	-	A well-trained Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) can classify cherry leaves with at least 90% accuracy.
3.	Scalability to Other Crops is Feasible:
	-	The same ML pipeline can be fine-tuned to detect other plant diseases.
